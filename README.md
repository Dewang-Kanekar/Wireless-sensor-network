# Wireless-sensor-network
in this project i classify various WSN model with help of python and various libraries of it

A) Python Libraries:
1.NumPy (pip install numpy):
For mathematical operations, especially for handling node positions, distances, and energy calculations in a WSN.

2.Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib):
For data visualization and plotting the network graph, node statuses, and performance metrics like the CDF of remaining energy.

3.NetworkX (pip install networkx):
To model the sensor network as a graph where nodes represent sensors and edges represent communication links.

4.Tkinter:
A standard Python library used to develop the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the project, helping you visualize network behavior interactively.

5.Scipy (pip install scipy):
Optional, but useful for advanced scientific and engineering calculations, including optimization or interpolation techniques.

6.Seaborn (pip install seaborn):
For more refined and aesthetic statistical visualizations (e.g., for generating graphs comparing energy consumption).

7.Pandas (pip install pandas):
For managing and analyzing tabular data efficiently, such as storing performance metrics from different simulation runs.

B) WSN Protocol Algorithms

1.LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy:
You will need to implement clustering algorithms where nodes elect cluster heads, communicate within clusters, and balance energy consumption.

2.MAC (Medium Access Control Protocols):
MAC protocols like TDMA or CSMA, which manage how data transmission occurs between nodes, avoiding collisions and managing power.

3.Directed Diffusion:
A data-centric routing protocol for WSN, involving interest message propagation and reinforcement learning to establish optimal data paths.

C) Graph and Statistical Algorithms:

1.Shortest Path Algorithms (like Dijkstra's):
Used for Directed Diffusion to simulate how interest messages or data packets are routed in a WSN.

2.K-Means Clustering:
Can be used for cluster head selection in LEACH, helping to identify the most central nodes as cluster heads.

3.CDF Calculation:
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of remaining energy, comparing the performance of different protocols. You can calculate it using Python (via numpy or scipy) and visualize it using matplotlib or seaborn.

D)Additional Libraries (for more advanced use):

1.SimPy (pip install simpy):
If you want to use a more formal simulation framework for event-driven simulations of WSNs.

2.Scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn):
Useful for clustering techniques (like K-Means) and analysis of performance metrics.

E) Summary:
Core Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, NetworkX, Tkinter.
Optional Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy, SimPy, Scikit-learn.
Algorithms: LEACH, MAC protocols, Directed Diffusion, Clustering (e.g., K-Means), Shortest Path (for routing), and CDF calculations.
These libraries and algorithms will cover both the simulation of different WSN protocols and the visualization of their performance in terms of energy efficiency, network lifetime, and data routing.
